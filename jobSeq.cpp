/*
### Explanation of the Program:

1. *Job Class*: Represents a job with an identifier, a deadline, and a profit.

2. *printJobSequence Method*: 
   - Sorts the jobs in descending order based on profit.
   - Determines the maximum deadline from the jobs to set up the scheduling slots.
   - Initializes an array for the result and a boolean array to track filled slots.
   - Iterates through the sorted jobs and assigns each job to the latest available slot before its deadline.
   - Calculates the total profit from the scheduled jobs.

3. *Main Method*:
   - Accepts user input for the number of jobs and their details (id, deadline, and profit).
   - Calls the printJobSequence method to process the jobs and display the results.

### Sample Input and Output:

*Input:*

5         // total no of jobs
a 2 100   // job class having - a-identifier, 2-deadline, 100-profit
b 1 19
c 2 27
d 1 25
e 3 15


*Output:*

Job Sequence: a c e 
Total Profit: 142


### Breakdown of Output:

- *Job Sequence*: 
  - *a*: Scheduled in slot 1 (deadline 2).
  - *c*: Scheduled in slot 2 (also has a deadline of 2, but slot 1 was filled by 'a').
  - *e*: Scheduled in slot 3 (fits within its deadline).

- *Total Profit*: 
  - From the scheduled jobs:
    - Job 'a' (profit 100)
    - Job 'c' (profit 27)
    - Job 'e' (profit 15)
  - Total Profit = 100 + 27 + 15 = 142.

### Summary:
This program effectively schedules jobs to maximize profit while respecting their deadlines, providing a clear view of which jobs were chosen and the total profit generated.
